Command Line
============

There is an exposed command line interface that is available upon
installation of the repository.  It can be run with ``orcoursetrion``, and
``orcoursetrion --help`` will provide the most up to date help information.

The command allows you to run commands that correspond to actions,
currently the only supported action is ``create_export_repo``, and if
your configuration is setup correctly (see :ref:`configuration`), and
at least minimally have set
:py:attr:`~orcoursetrion.config.ORC_GH_OAUTH2_TOKEN` and you run
``orcoursetrion create_export_repo -t Spring_2030 -c DevOps.001 -d 'My
awesome class repo'`` you should see it respond with the URL of the
repo that it just created for you.


Available Actions

:create_export_repo:

   This will create a new repository with the content deployment team
   from :py:attr:`~orcoursetrion.config.ORC_STUDIO_DEPLOY_TEAM` added to
   the repository.

:rerun_studio:

   This will remove all Web hooks from the course specified by

   with the :py:attr:`~orcoursetrion.config.ORC_STUDIO_DEPLOY_TEAM` added.

:release_studio:

   This will add the production git Web hook to the course specified
   with :py:attr:`~orcoursetrion.config.ORC_PRODUCTION_GITRELOAD`.

:create_xml_repo:

   This will create a new repository with the
   :py:attr:`~orcoursetrion.config.ORC_XML_DEPLOY_TEAM` and a command
   line specified team added to repository.  It will also set up a git
   hook to the URL specified with
   :py:attr:`~orcoursetrion.config.ORC_STAGING_GITRELOAD`. The
   membership of the team can also be specified, and will replace the
   existing membership of the team if it already exists.

   members of the team that should replace the existing team.
